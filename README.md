# Key-Value-Data-Store
Developed a key-value (kv) data store with advanced functionality, supporting Create, Read, and Delete (CRD) operations.  The data store is  exposed as a library, allowing clients to instantiate a class and interact with it programmatically.  Implementation ideally demonstrates a level of comfort with both functionality and performance.
